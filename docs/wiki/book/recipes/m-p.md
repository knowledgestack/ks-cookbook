### Meddic Call Coach

> **MEDDIC call coach — call transcript → cited MEDDIC coverage + gaps.**

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: AEs miss MEDDIC fields on discovery calls (Metrics, Economic
buyer, Decision criteria, Decision process, Identify pain, Champion). This
recipe scores coverage from the transcript and flags gaps with citations to
your sales playbook.

Framework: pydantic-ai. Tools: list_contents, search_knowledge, read.
Output: stdout (JSON).

#### How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.
5. The validated pydantic object is printed as JSON to stdout. Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a real chunk in your tenant.

#### Sign in to Knowledge Stack

**Path A — `ingestion: true` (shared cookbook tenant, fastest)**

Sign in at <https://app.knowledgestack.ai>, request a read-only "Cookbook demo" key, then:

```bash
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Skip to step 5 (Run).

**Path B — `ingestion: false` (clone repo, ingest into your own tenant)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knowledgestack/ks-cookbook
cd ks-cookbook
make install
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...   # your own KS key
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

#### Ingest the unified corpus

Path B only — one-time. The bundled `seed/` folder has 34 real public-domain documents (CMS ICD-10, NIST 800-53, IRS Pubs, OCC Handbook, KO 10-K, AAPL 2024 proxy, FAR, NERC CIP, FDA Orange Book, BLS XLSX, CDC PPTX, …). Create a parent folder in your tenant via the UI, then:

```bash
make seed-unified-corpus PARENT_FOLDER_ID=<your-folder-uuid>
```

#### Inputs

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Help |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `--call-name` | str | yes | — |  |

| `--transcript-file` | str | yes | — |  |


**Sample inputs available** in `sample_inputs/`:

- `discovery_call_001.txt`

#### Output schema

`MEDDICReport` — pydantic model emitted as JSON to stdout.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|

| `call` | `str` |

| `fields` | `list[MEDDICField]` |

| `overall_grade` | `str` |

| `top_3_followups` | `list[str]` |

#### Run

```bash
uv run python recipes/meddic_call_coach/recipe.py \
    --call-name "demo" \
    --transcript-file recipes/meddic_call_coach/sample_inputs/discovery_call_001.txt
```

#### Live verified output

Verified end-to-end against `api.knowledgestack.ai` on **2026-04-28** with `MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` (~70.2s):

```json
{
  "call": "demo",
  "fields": [
    {
      "field": "identify_pain",
      "coverage": "strong",
      "evidence_in_call": "Average resolution time is 4 hours for field techs to get engineering documents, leading to financial losses due
```

Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker; snippets and document names are real chunk content from the ingested corpus.

#### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Set KS_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY.` | Export both env vars before running. |
| `Tool 'read' exceeded max retries` | gpt-4o-mini occasionally calls `read(<chunk_id>)` instead of `read(<path_part_id>)`. Re-run; the prompt self-corrects within `retries=4`. Switching to `MODEL=gpt-4o` removes the flake. |
| Empty / non-grounded output | The corpus isn't ingested into your tenant. Run `make seed-unified-corpus PARENT_FOLDER_ID=<uuid>`. |
| `Connection error` from OpenAI | Transient; retry. |
| `request_limit of 50` exceeded | The agent looped too many tools. Re-run; this is rare. |

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: Beneficiaries (and their brokers) compare Medigap / Advantage
plans across premium, out-of-pocket, network, and drug formulary. This recipe
pulls the plans from your corpus and returns a cited side-by-side table.

Framework: pydantic-ai. Tools: list_contents, search_knowledge, read.
Output: stdout (JSON).

#### How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.
5. The validated pydantic object is printed as JSON to stdout. Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a real chunk in your tenant.

#### Sign in to Knowledge Stack

**Path A — `ingestion: true` (shared cookbook tenant, fastest)**

```bash
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Skip to step 5 (Run).

**Path B — `ingestion: false` (clone repo, ingest into your own tenant)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knowledgestack/ks-cookbook
cd ks-cookbook
make install
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...   # your own KS key
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai

```bash
make seed-unified-corpus PARENT_FOLDER_ID=<your-folder-uuid>
```

#### Inputs

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Help |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `--profile` | str | yes | — | e.g. '67yo, Medicare A+B, OC CA, metformin' |

#### Output schema

`PlanComparison` — pydantic model emitted as JSON to stdout.

| Field | Type |

| `beneficiary_profile` | `str` |

| `plans` | `list[PlanCompareRow]` |

| `narrative` | `str` |

#### Run

```bash
uv run python recipes/medicare_plan_compare/recipe.py \
    --profile "demo"
```

#### Live verified output

Verified end-to-end against `api.knowledgestack.ai` on **2026-04-28** with `MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` (~13.0s):

```json
{
  "beneficiary_profile": "demo",

      "monthly_premium": "$30",
      "moop": "$4,000",
      "network_note": "In-network providers on
```

Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker; snippets and document names are real chunk content from the ingested corpus.

#### Troubleshooting

### Meeting Notes Action Items

> **Meeting notes → cited action items / decisions / risks.**

10. [Files](#files)

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: after every meeting someone has to turn the transcript into a
shared doc of decisions + action items + risks, usually ~20 minutes of
copy-paste, and half the items drop because nobody owns them.

This recipe reads the transcript (plus any linked prep docs) from KS and
emits a structured summary with owners, due dates (if mentioned), and
citations. No owner invented that isn't named in the source.

Framework: pydantic-ai. Tools: list_contents, search_knowledge, read.
Output: stdout (JSON).

#### How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.
5. The validated pydantic object is printed as JSON to stdout. Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a real chunk in your tenant.

#### Live verified output

Verified end-to-end against `api.knowledgestack.ai` on **2026-04-28** with `MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` (~29.4s):

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: Customers ping support asking how to move from v3 → v4. Eng writes
the same guide from scratch every time. This recipe reads release notes +

Pain point: Controllers write the same month-end narrative for the CFO every
month (variance, accruals, reclass memos). This recipe pulls the trial
balance commentary + flux analysis notes from your corpus and drafts a
cited CFO memo.

Framework: pydantic-ai. Tools: list_contents, search_knowledge, read.
Output: stdout (JSON).

#### How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.
5. The validated pydantic object is printed as JSON to stdout. Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a real chunk in your tenant.

#### Sign in to Knowledge Stack

**Path A — `ingestion: true` (shared cookbook tenant, fastest)**

Sign in at <https://app.knowledgestack.ai>, request a read-only "Cookbook demo" key, then:

```bash
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Skip to step 5 (Run).

**Path B — `ingestion: false` (clone repo, ingest into your own tenant)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knowledgestack/ks-cookbook
cd ks-cookbook
make install
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...   # your own KS key
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

#### Ingest the unified corpus

Path B only — one-time. The bundled `seed/` folder has 34 real public-domain documents (CMS ICD-10, NIST 800-53, IRS Pubs, OCC Handbook, KO 10-K, AAPL 2024 proxy, FAR, NERC CIP, FDA Orange Book, BLS XLSX, CDC PPTX, …). Create a parent folder in your tenant via the UI, then:

```bash
make seed-unified-corpus PARENT_FOLDER_ID=<your-folder-uuid>
```

#### Inputs

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Help |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `--period` | str | no | 'March 2026' |  |

#### Output schema

`CloseMemo` — pydantic model emitted as JSON to stdout.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|

| `period` | `str` |

| `tl_dr` | `str` |

| `material_variances` | `list[Variance]` |

| `accruals_and_reclass` | `list[str]` |

| `open_items` | `list[str]` |

#### Run

```bash
uv run python recipes/month_end_close_narrative/recipe.py
```

#### Live verified output

Verified end-to-end against `api.knowledgestack.ai` on **2026-04-28** with `MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` (~7.9s):

```json
{
  "period": "March 2026",
  "tl_dr": "Summary of material variances for March 2026. No variances to report this month.",
  "material_variances": [
    {
      "account": "General Expenses",
      "actual_vs_budget": "Actual exceeded budge
```

Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker; snippets and document names are real chunk content from the ingested corpus.

#### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Set KS_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY.` | Export both env vars before running. |
| `Tool 'read' exceeded max retries` | gpt-4o-mini occasionally calls `read(<chunk_id>)` instead of `read(<path_part_id>)`. Re-run; the prompt self-corrects within `retries=4`. Switching to `MODEL=gpt-4o` removes the flake. |
| Empty / non-grounded output | The corpus isn't ingested into your tenant. Run `make seed-unified-corpus PARENT_FOLDER_ID=<uuid>`. |
| `Connection error` from OpenAI | Transient; retry. |
| `request_limit of 50` exceeded | The agent looped too many tools. Re-run; this is rare. |

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: Legal/Sales triages every inbound NDA; basic checks (data
classification, retention, sub-processor flow-down, governing law) are
mechanical but get redone each time.

Framework: pydantic-ai with a structured ``NDAReview`` result type.
Tools used: list_contents, read.
Output: stdout (JSON).

#### How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.
5. The validated pydantic object is printed as JSON to stdout. Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a real chunk in your tenant.

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: People reviews put every IC on a 9-box (performance × potential).
Managers argue from feelings. This recipe reads the perf docs (retros, peer
feedback, 1:1 notes) and places each person with cited evidence.

Framework: pydantic-ai. Tools: list_contents, search_knowledge, read.

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: "We committed to a 99.9% SLA" — where? by when? to whom? Contracts

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: HR copy-pastes the same policy bits into a new-hire doc for every
role. This recipe enumerates the policies folder, lets GPT pick the relevant
documents via OpenAI tool-calling, reads them over MCP stdio, and emits a
markdown checklist with inline `[chunk:<uuid>]` citations from `read` output.

Framework: raw OpenAI function-calling against MCP stdio (no agent framework).

#### How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.
5. The validated pydantic object is printed as JSON to stdout. Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a real chunk in your tenant.

### Onboarding Day One Plan

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: Managers re-invent onboarding for every hire. This recipe pulls
the company onboarding policy + role-specific learning plan and produces a
day-one and week-one task list with citations.

Framework: pydantic-ai. Tools: list_contents, search_knowledge, read.
Output: stdout (JSON).

#### How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.
5. The validated pydantic object is printed as JSON to stdout. Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a real chunk in your tenant.

#### Sign in to Knowledge Stack

**Path A — `ingestion: true` (shared cookbook tenant, fastest)**

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: New engineers get thrown into the pager with no structured shadow.
This recipe builds a 4-week shadow plan grounded in your on-call policy,
runbooks, and past incidents.

Framework: pydantic-ai. Tools: list_contents, search_knowledge, read.

10. [Files](#files)

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: Security wants to confirm that a system's password / MFA / session
config actually matches the written policy. Today this means a human reads the
policy, reads the config, and writes a memo. This recipe does it deterministically.

Framework: MCP-only (no LLM). Pulls the password/auth policy and prints a
side-by-side audit table with citations.
Tools used: search_keyword, read.
Output: file (auth-audit.md).

#### How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: Patent counsel manually searches USPTO / EPO filings for prior
art; the first pass is mechanical. This recipe searches your ingested patent
corpus, scores candidate references by relevance, and cites the exact chunks
that overlap with the claim.

Framework: pydantic-ai. Tools: list_contents, search_knowledge, read.

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: PCI DSS scope debates eat hours before every audit. This recipe
reads your CDE diagram + data-flow doc and returns a cited classification
(in-scope, connected, out-of-scope) with the controls that apply.

Framework: pydantic-ai. Tools: list_contents, search_knowledge, read.
Output: stdout (JSON).

#### How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.
5. The validated pydantic object is printed as JSON to stdout. Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a real chunk in your tenant.

#### Sign in to Knowledge Stack

**Path A — `ingestion: true` (shared cookbook tenant, fastest)**

Sign in at <https://app.knowledgestack.ai>, request a read-only "Cookbook demo" key, then:

```bash
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Skip to step 5 (Run).

**Path B — `ingestion: false` (clone repo, ingest into your own tenant)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knowledgestack/ks-cookbook
cd ks-cookbook
make install
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...   # your own KS key
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

#### Ingest the unified corpus

Path B only — one-time. The bundled `seed/` folder has 34 real public-domain documents (CMS ICD-10, NIST 800-53, IRS Pubs, OCC Handbook, KO 10-K, AAPL 2024 proxy, FAR, NERC CIP, FDA Orange Book, BLS XLSX, CDC PPTX, …). Create a parent folder in your tenant via the UI, then:

```bash
make seed-unified-corpus PARENT_FOLDER_ID=<your-folder-uuid>
```

#### Inputs

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: Managers write reviews from memory. This recipe pulls citable

#### What this recipe does

Pain point every enterprise buyer asks about:
  "If my agent queries our knowledge base, how do I stop it from leaking a
   document to a user who wouldn't otherwise have access?"

KS's answer: identity lives in your IdP (Okta/Azure AD/Google); permissions
live in KS. Your developer holds a dev-issued API key per END-USER, and KS
enforces that user's ``PathPermission`` tuple on every retrieval call.

This recipe runs the SAME ReAct agent loop twice — once with Alice's key
(scoped to access + ir policies), once with Bob's (scoped to sdlc + vendor).
Each agent is asked the same question: "Summarise every policy you can see."

If KS enforcement works, Alice and Bob's answers will be different.

Framework: pydantic-ai (swap to any — auth is about the API key, not the framework).

Seed two users + keys first:
    uv run --env-file .env.e2e python seed/seed_cookbook_users.py

#### How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.
5. The validated pydantic object is printed as JSON to stdout. Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a real chunk in your tenant.

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: Employees slack "do we allow BYOD?", "what's our password rotation?",
"what's the incident response number?" — all buried in policy PDFs.

This recipe: question in → cited answer out in <3 seconds for common questions.

Framework: raw MCP + OpenAI (no agent framework — shortest possible code path).

#### How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.
5. The validated pydantic object is printed as JSON to stdout. Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a real chunk in your tenant.

#### Sign in to Knowledge Stack

**Path A — `ingestion: true` (shared cookbook tenant, fastest)**

Sign in at <https://app.knowledgestack.ai>, request a read-only "Cookbook demo" key, then:

```bash
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Skip to step 5 (Run).

**Path B — `ingestion: false` (clone repo, ingest into your own tenant)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knowledgestack/ks-cookbook
cd ks-cookbook
make install
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...   # your own KS key
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

#### Ingest the unified corpus

Path B only — one-time. The bundled `seed/` folder has 34 real public-domain documents (CMS ICD-10, NIST 800-53, IRS Pubs, OCC Handbook, KO 10-K, AAPL 2024 proxy, FAR, NERC CIP, FDA Orange Book, BLS XLSX, CDC PPTX, …). Create a parent folder in your tenant via the UI, then:

```bash
make seed-unified-corpus PARENT_FOLDER_ID=<your-folder-uuid>
```

#### Inputs

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Help |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `--question` | str | yes | — |  |

#### Output schema

Output is JSON printed to stdout.

#### Run

```bash
uv run python recipes/policy_qa/recipe.py \
    --question "What ERISA disclosures must an employer provide to participants in the SPD?"
```

#### Live verified output

Verified end-to-end against `api.knowledgestack.ai` on **2026-04-28** with `MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` (~4.6s):

```json
{
  "answer_markdown": "The provided policy text does not include information on ERISA disclosures that an employer must provide to participants in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). \n\nSource: [chunk:019dd206-dc0d-7831-a7ae-5613118af66f]
```

Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker; snippets and document names are real chunk content from the ingested corpus.

#### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Set KS_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY.` | Export both env vars before running. |
| `Tool 'read' exceeded max retries` | gpt-4o-mini occasionally calls `read(<chunk_id>)` instead of `read(<path_part_id>)`. Re-run; the prompt self-corrects within `retries=4`. Switching to `MODEL=gpt-4o` removes the flake. |
| Empty / non-grounded output | The corpus isn't ingested into your tenant. Run `make seed-unified-corpus PARENT_FOLDER_ID=<uuid>`. |
| `Connection error` from OpenAI | Transient; retry. |
| `request_limit of 50` exceeded | The agent looped too many tools. Re-run; this is rare. |

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: After a deploy, engineers "spot-check" — no checklist. This recipe
produces a concrete verification plan (SLO checks, smoke tests, log patterns,
rollback triggers) grounded in your SRE runbooks.

Framework: pydantic-ai. Tools: list_contents, search_knowledge, read.
Output: stdout (JSON).

#### How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: Procurement intake forms pile up; IT, security, legal each want

#### What this recipe does

Pain point: Personalization at scale is fake personalization. This recipe
grounds each hook in something we actually know (past interaction, public
