# Contract Obligation Extractor

Legal flagship — extract every shall/must/will obligation from a contract, grouped by obligation-holder, with [chunk:<uuid>] citations.

Built on **Knowledge Stack** — the document intelligence layer for agents. Every output cites the exact `[chunk:<uuid>]` it came from, so reviewers can trace any sentence back to source.

## What it does

- Connects to your `knowledgestack-mcp` server over stdio.
- Enumerates the `Legal` corpus folder, reads relevant chunks, and produces a structured pydantic output.
- Writes a Word/Markdown/Excel artifact your team can ship to a customer, regulator, or internal reviewer.
- Refuses to fabricate citations: every `chunk_id` is copied verbatim from `read` tool output (CI-enforced).

## Try it in 60 seconds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knowledgestack/ks-cookbook
cd ks-cookbook
echo "KS_API_KEY=ks_..." > .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> .env
make setup
make demo-contract-obligation-extractor
```

Output: a cited `.md` / `.docx` / `.xlsx` you can hand to a reviewer.

## SDKs

- **Python:** `pip install ksapi`
- **TypeScript:** `npm i @knowledge-stack/ksapi`
- **MCP:** `uvx knowledgestack-mcp` (works in Claude Desktop, Cursor, any MCP host)

## Why citations matter for Legal

In Legal, an unsourced AI answer is a liability. Knowledge Stack threads `[chunk:<uuid>]` markers through every read, and the schema rejects outputs that lack them. That's the difference between a demo and a control your auditors accept.
