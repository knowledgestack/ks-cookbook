## What this recipe does

Pain point: Discharge summaries are dense jargon; AHRQ says patient-friendly
rewrites reduce readmits. This recipe rewrites at ~6th-grade reading level,
preserves every medication and follow-up, and cites the source sentences.

Framework: pydantic-ai. Tools: list_contents, search_knowledge, read.
Output: stdout (JSON).

## How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.
5. The validated pydantic object is printed as JSON to stdout. Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a real chunk in your tenant.

## Sign in to Knowledge Stack

**Path A — `ingestion: true` (shared cookbook tenant, fastest)**

Sign in at <https://app.knowledgestack.ai>, request a read-only "Cookbook demo" key, then:

```bash
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Skip to step 5 (Run).

**Path B — `ingestion: false` (clone repo, ingest into your own tenant)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knowledgestack/ks-cookbook
cd ks-cookbook
make install
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...   # your own KS key
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

## Ingest the unified corpus

Path B only — one-time. The bundled `seed/` folder has 34 real public-domain documents (CMS ICD-10, NIST 800-53, IRS Pubs, OCC Handbook, KO 10-K, AAPL 2024 proxy, FAR, NERC CIP, FDA Orange Book, BLS XLSX, CDC PPTX, …). Create a parent folder in your tenant via the UI, then:

```bash
make seed-unified-corpus PARENT_FOLDER_ID=<your-folder-uuid>
```

## Inputs

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Help |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `--summary-file` | str | yes | — |  |


**Sample inputs available** in `sample_inputs/`:

- `discharge_summary_001.txt`

## Output schema

`PatientSummary` — pydantic model emitted as JSON to stdout.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|

| `what_happened` | `str` |

| `your_medications` | `list[str]` |

| `follow_ups` | `list[str]` |

| `call_doctor_if` | `list[str]` |

| `citations` | `list[Citation]` |

## Run

```bash
uv run python recipes/discharge_summary_rewrite/recipe.py \
    --summary-file recipes/discharge_summary_rewrite/sample_inputs/discharge_summary_001.txt
```

## Live verified output

Verified end-to-end against `api.knowledgestack.ai` on **2026-04-28** with `MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` (~33.5s):

```json
{
  "what_happened": "You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain and confirmed to have a type of heart attack called NSTEMI. You were treated with medications and underwent a procedure to open up blocked arteries. You are stable and
```

Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker; snippets and document names are real chunk content from the ingested corpus.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Set KS_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY.` | Export both env vars before running. |
| `Tool 'read' exceeded max retries` | gpt-4o-mini occasionally calls `read(<chunk_id>)` instead of `read(<path_part_id>)`. Re-run; the prompt self-corrects within `retries=4`. Switching to `MODEL=gpt-4o` removes the flake. |
| Empty / non-grounded output | The corpus isn't ingested into your tenant. Run `make seed-unified-corpus PARENT_FOLDER_ID=<uuid>`. |
| `Connection error` from OpenAI | Transient; retry. |
| `request_limit of 50` exceeded | The agent looped too many tools. Re-run; this is rare. |
