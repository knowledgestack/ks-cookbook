## What this recipe does

Pain point: Counterparty Data Processing Addenda often omit standard GDPR
Article 28 obligations. Privacy/legal redoes the same gap analysis each time.
This recipe: DPA text in → list of missing or weak clauses out, each cited
to the company's data-protection policy.

Framework: raw OpenAI chat completions + MCP stdio.
Tools used: list_contents, read.
Output: stdout (markdown).

## How it works

1. The recipe spawns the `knowledgestack-mcp` stdio server (auth via `KS_API_KEY`).
2. A pydantic-ai `Agent` is built with a strict pydantic output schema and `gpt-4o`/`gpt-4o-mini`.
3. The agent asks Knowledge Stack natural-language questions via `search_knowledge`. **It never passes folder UUIDs** — KS finds the right document by content.
4. For every search hit the agent calls `read(path_part_id=<hit>)` to retrieve the full chunk text. The trailing `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker is the citation.
5. The validated pydantic object is printed as JSON to stdout. Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a real chunk in your tenant.

## Sign in to Knowledge Stack

**Path A — `ingestion: true` (shared cookbook tenant, fastest)**

Sign in at <https://app.knowledgestack.ai>, request a read-only "Cookbook demo" key, then:

```bash
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Skip to step 5 (Run).

**Path B — `ingestion: false` (clone repo, ingest into your own tenant)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knowledgestack/ks-cookbook
cd ks-cookbook
make install
export KS_API_KEY=sk-user-...   # your own KS key
export KS_BASE_URL=https://api.knowledgestack.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

## Ingest the unified corpus

Path B only — one-time. The bundled `seed/` folder has 34 real public-domain documents (CMS ICD-10, NIST 800-53, IRS Pubs, OCC Handbook, KO 10-K, AAPL 2024 proxy, FAR, NERC CIP, FDA Orange Book, BLS XLSX, CDC PPTX, …). Create a parent folder in your tenant via the UI, then:

```bash
make seed-unified-corpus PARENT_FOLDER_ID=<your-folder-uuid>
```

## Inputs

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Help |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `--dpa-file` | str | no | — | Path to counterparty DPA text. Default: built-in sample. |


**Sample inputs available** in `sample_inputs/`:

- `vendor_dpa_acme.txt`

## Output schema

Output is JSON printed to stdout.

## Run

```bash
uv run python recipes/dpa_gap_check/recipe.py \
    --dpa-file recipes/dpa_gap_check/sample_inputs/vendor_dpa_acme.txt
```

## Live verified output

Verified end-to-end against `api.knowledgestack.ai` on **2026-04-28** with `MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` (~6.7s):

```json
{
  "gap_analysis_markdown": "The DPA provided by the counterparty is not fully compliant with the company's data protection policy. Here are the identified gaps:\n\n- **Purpose Specification** \u2014 The DPA lacks a clear requirement for A
```

Every `chunk_id` is a verbatim UUID from a `[chunk:<uuid>]` marker; snippets and document names are real chunk content from the ingested corpus.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Set KS_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY.` | Export both env vars before running. |
| `Tool 'read' exceeded max retries` | gpt-4o-mini occasionally calls `read(<chunk_id>)` instead of `read(<path_part_id>)`. Re-run; the prompt self-corrects within `retries=4`. Switching to `MODEL=gpt-4o` removes the flake. |
| Empty / non-grounded output | The corpus isn't ingested into your tenant. Run `make seed-unified-corpus PARENT_FOLDER_ID=<uuid>`. |
| `Connection error` from OpenAI | Transient; retry. |
| `request_limit of 50` exceeded | The agent looped too many tools. Re-run; this is rare. |
